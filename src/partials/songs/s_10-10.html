<P>I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
<BR>I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
<BR>I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
<BR>No,no,no.

<P>I'm so tired I don't know what to do
<BR>I'm so tired my mind is set on you
<BR>I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do

<P>You'd say I'm putting you on
<BR>But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
<BR>You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
<BR>You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
<BR>You know I'd give you everything I've got
<BR>for a little peace of mind

<P>I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
<BR>Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
<BR>And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
<BR>He was such a stupid get.
