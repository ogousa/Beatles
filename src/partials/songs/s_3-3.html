<P>If I fell in love with you
<BR>Would you promise to be true
<BR>And help me understand
<BR>'cause I've been in love before
<BR>And I found that love was more
<BR>Than just holding hands

<P>If I give my heart to you
<BR>I must be sure
<BR>From the very start
<BR>That you would love me more than her

<P>If I trust in you oh please
<BR>Don't run and hide
<BR>If I love you too oh please
<BR>Don't hurt my pride like her
<BR>'cause I couldn't stand the pain
<BR>And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

<P>So I hope you see that I
<BR>Would love to love you
<BR>And that she will cry
<BR>When she learns we are two

<P>If I fell in love with you
