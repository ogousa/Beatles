<P>This happened once before,
<BR>When I came to your door,
<BR>No reply.
<BR>They said it wasn't you,
<BR>But I saw you peep through your window,
<BR>I saw the light, I saw the light,
<BR>I know that you saw me,
<BR>'cause I looked up to your face.

<P>I tried to telephone,
<BR>They said you were not home,
<BR>That's a lie,
<BR>'cause I know where you've been,
<BR>I saw you walk in your door,
<BR>I nearly died, I nearly died,
<BR>'cause you walked hand in hand
<BR>With another man in my place.

<P>If I were you'd realize that I
<BR>Love you more than any other guy,
<BR>And I'll forgive the lies that I
<BR>Heard before when you gave me no reply.
