<P>He's a real nowhere Man,
<BR>Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
<BR>Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
<BR>Doesn't kave a point of view,
<BR>Knows not where he's going to,
<BR>Isn't he a bit like you and me?

<P>Nowhere Man, please listen,
<BR>You don't know what you're missing,
<BR>Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

<P>He's as blind as he can be,
<BR>Just sees what he wants to see,
<BR>Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
<BR>Doesn't kave a point of view,
<BR>Knows not where he's going to,
<BR>Isn't he a bit like you and me?

<P>Nowhere Man, don't worry,
<BR>Take your time, don't hurry,
<BR>Leave it all till somebody else lend you a hand.

<P>He's a real Nowhere Man,
<BR>Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
<BR>Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
