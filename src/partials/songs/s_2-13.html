<P>You know you made me cry,
<BR>I see no use in wond'ring why,
<BR>I cried for you.

<P>And now, you've changed your mind,
<BR>I see no reason to change mine,
<BR>I cried, it's through, oh.

<P>Oh, you're giving me the same old line,
<BR>I'm wond'ring why,
<BR>You hurt me then, you're back again,
<BR>No, no, not a second time.
