<P>Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
<BR>But she was another man
<BR>All the girls around her say she's got it coming
<BR>But she gets it while she can
<BR>Get back, get back.
<BR>Get back to where you once belonged
<BR>Get back, get back.
<BR>Get back to where you once belonged.
<BR>Get back Loretta. Go home
<BR>Get back, get back.
<BR>Get back to where you once belonged
<BR>Get back, get back.
<BR>Get back to where you once belonged.
<BR>Get back Loretta
<BR>Your mother's waiting for you
<BR>Wearing her high-heel shoes
<BR>And her low-neck sweater
<BR>Get on home Loretta
<BR>Get back, get back.
<BR>Get back to where you once belonged.
