<P>She's not a girl who misses much
<BR>Do do do do do do do do
<BR>She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
<BR>Like a lizard on a window pane.

<P>The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
<BR>On his hobnail boots
<BR>Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
<BR>Working overtime
<BR>A soap impression of his wife which he ate
<BR>And donated to the Nation Trust.

<P>I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
<BR>Down to the bits that I left uptown
<BR>I need a fix cause I'm going down
<BR>Mother Superior jump the gun
<BR>Mother Superior jump the gun
<BR>Mother Superior jump the gun
<BR>Mother Superior jump the gun.

<P>Happiness is a warm gun
<BR>Happiness is a warm gun
<BR>When I hold you in my arms
<BR>And I feel my finger on your trigger
<BR>I know no one can do me no harm
<BR>Because happiness is a warm gun
<BR>-Yes it is.
