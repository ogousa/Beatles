<P>I was alone, I took a ride,
<BR>I didn't know what I would find there
<BR>Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

<P>Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
<BR>Ooh, did I tell you I need you
<BR>Every single day of my life

<P>You didn't run, you didn't lie
<BR>You knew I wanted just to hold you
<BR>And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
<BR>For I had told you

<P>Ooh, you were meant to be near me
<BR>Ooh, and I want you hear me
<BR>Say we'll be together every day

<P>Got to get you into my life

<P>What can I do, what can I be,
<BR>When I'm with you I want to stay there
<BR>If I'm true I'll never leave
<BR>And if I do I know the way there

<P>Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
<BR>Ooh, did I tell you I need you
<BR>Every single day of my life

<P>Got to get you into my life
<BR>Got to get you into my life

<P>I was alone, I took a ride,
<BR>I didn't know what I would find there
<BR>Another road where maybe I could see another kind of
<BR>mind there

<P>Then suddenly I see you,
<BR>Did I tell you I need you...
