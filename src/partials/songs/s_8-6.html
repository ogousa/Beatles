<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begings
<BR>Silently closing her bedroom door
<BR>Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
<BR>She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
<BR>Quietly turing the backdoor key
<BR>Stepping outside she is free.

<P>She (We gave her most of our lives)
<BR>is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
<BR>home (We gave her everything money could buy)
<BR>She's leaving home after living alone
<BR>For so many years. Bye, bye

<P>Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
<BR>Picks up the letter that's lying there
<BR>Standing alone at the top of the stairs
<BR>She breaks down and cries to her husband
<BR>Daddy our baby's gone.
<BR>Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
<BR>How could she do this to me.

<P>She (We never though of ourselves)
<BR>Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
<BR>home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
<BR>She's leaving home after living alone
<BR>For so many years (Bye, bye)

<P>Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
<BR>Waiting to keep the appointment she made
<BR>Meeting a man from the motor trade.

<P>She (What did we do that was wrong)
<BR>Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
<BR>Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
<BR>Something inside that was always denied
<BR>For so many years (Bye, Bye)
<BR>She's leaving home (Bye bye)
