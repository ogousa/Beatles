<P>If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
<BR>We will never be apart if I'm part of you.
<BR>Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
<BR>It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
<BR>Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
<BR>If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day.
<BR>Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
<BR>Don't you realise now, what you see is me.
<BR>Tell me what you see.
<BR>Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
<BR>Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
<BR>Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
<BR>It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
<BR>Tell me what you see.
<BR>Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
<BR>Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
