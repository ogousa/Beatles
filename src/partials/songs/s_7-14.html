<P>Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream,
<BR>It is not dying, it is not dying

<P>Lay down al thoughts, surrender to the void,
<BR>It is shining, it is shining.

<P>Yet you may see the meaning of within
<BR>It is being, it is being

<P>Love is all and love is everyone
<BR>It is knowing, it is knowing

<P>And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
<BR>It is believing, it is believing

<P>But listen to the colour of your dreams
<BR>It is not leaving, it is not leaving

<P>So play the game "Existence" to the end
<BR>Of the beginning, of the beginning
