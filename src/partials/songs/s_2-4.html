<P>Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me.
<BR>It's not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see.

<P>So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me.

<P>I can't believe that she would leave me on my own.
<BR>It's just not right when every night I'm all alone.

<P>I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.

<P>I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
<BR>Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

<P>But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
<BR>I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day,

<P>Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
