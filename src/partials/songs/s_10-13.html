<P>Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
<BR>There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
<BR>And one day his woman ran off with another guy
<BR>Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that
<BR>He said I'm gonna get that boy
<BR>So one day he walked into town
<BR>Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

<P>Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
<BR>Only to find Gideon's bible
<BR>Rocky had come equipped with a gun
<BR>To shoot off the legs of his rival
<BR>His rival it seems had broken his dreams
<BR>By stealing the girl of his fancy.
<BR>Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
<BR>But everyone knew her as Nancy.
<BR>Now she and her man who called himself Dan
<BR>Were in the next room at the hoe down
<BR>Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
<BR>He said Danny boy this is a showdown
<BR>But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot
<BR>And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

<P>Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
<BR>And proceeded to lie on the table
<BR>He said Rocky you met your match
<BR>And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch
<BR>And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able.

<P>Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
<BR>Only to find Gideon's bible
<BR>Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
<BR>To help with good Rocky's revival.
