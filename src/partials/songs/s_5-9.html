<P>I get high when I see you go by
<BR>My oh my.
<BR>When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
<BR>Butterflies
<BR>Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
<BR>It's only love and that is all,
<BR>Why should I feel the way I do?
<BR>It's only love, and that is all,
<BR>But it's so hard loving you.

<P>Is it right that you and I should fight
<BR>Ev'ry night?
<BR>Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
<BR>Very bright.
<BR>Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
<BR>It's only love and that is all,
<BR>Why should I feel the way I do?
<BR>It's only love, and that is all
<BR>But it's so hard loving you
<BR>Yes it's so hard loving you -- loving you.
