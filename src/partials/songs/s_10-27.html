<P>Creme tangerine and montelimat
<BR>A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
<BR>A coffee dessert--yes you know it's good news
<BR>But you'll have to have them all pulled out
<BR>After the Savoy truffle.

<P>Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
<BR>I feel your taste all the time we're apart
<BR>Coconut fudge--really blows down those blues
<BR>But you'll have to have them all pulled out
<BR>After the Savoy truffle.

<P>You might not feel it now
<BR>But when the pain cuts through
<BR>You're going to know and how
<BR>The sweat is going to fill your head
<BR>When it becomes too much
<BR>You're going to shout aloud
<BR>--Creme tangerine.

<P>You know that what you eat you are,
<BR>But what is sweet now, turns so sour--
<BR>We all know Obla-Di-Bla-Da
<BR>But can you show me, where you are?..

<P>Creme tangerine and montelimat
<BR>A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
<BR>A coffee dessert--yes you know its good news
<BR>But you'll have to have them all pulled out
<BR>After the Savoy truffle.
