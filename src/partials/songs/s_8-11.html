<P>Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
<BR>Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
<BR>Nothing to do it's up to you
<BR>I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
<BR>Good morning, good morning...
<BR>Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
<BR>Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
<BR>Everybody knows there's nothing doing
<BR>Everything is closed it's like a ruin
<BR>Everyone you see is half asleep.
<BR>And you're on your own you're in the street
<BR>Good morning, good morning...
<BR>After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
<BR>Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
<BR>Nothing has changed it's still the same
<BR>I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
<BR>Good morning, good morning...
<BR>People running round it's five o'clock.
<BR>Everywhere in town is getting dark.
<BR>Everyone you see is full of life.
<BR>It's time for tea and meet the wife.
<BR>Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.
<BR>Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.
<BR>Go to a show you hope she goes.
<BR>I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
<BR>Good morning, good morning...
