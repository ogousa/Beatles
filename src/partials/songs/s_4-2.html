<P>I'm a loser
<BR>I'm a loser
<BR>And I'm not what I appear to be

<P>Of all the love I have won or have lost
<BR>there is one love I should never have crossed
<BR>She was a girl in a million, my friend
<BR>I should have known she would win in the end

<P>I'm a loser
<BR>And I lost someone who's near to me
<BR>I'm a loser
<BR>And I'm not what I appear to be

<P>Although I laugh and I act like a clown
<BR>Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
<BR>My tears are falling like rain from the sky
<BR>Is it for her or myself that I cry

<P>I'm a loser
<BR>And I lost someone who's near to me
<BR>I'm a loser
<BR>And I'm not what I appear to be

<P>What have I done to deserve such a fate
<BR>I realize I have left it too late
<BR>And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
<BR>I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

<P>I'm a loser
<BR>And I lost someone who's near to me
<BR>I'm a loser
<BR>And I'm not what I appear to be
