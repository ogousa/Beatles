<P>When I wake up early in the morning

<P>Lift my head, I'm still yawning
<BR>When I'm in the middle of a dream
<BR>Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

<P>Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
<BR>Leave me where I am - I'm only sleeping

<P>Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
<BR>I don't mind, I think they're crazy
<BR>Running everywhere at such a speed
<BR>Till they find there's no need (there's no need)

<P>Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
<BR>And after all I'm only sleeping

<P>Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
<BR>Taking my time

<P>Lying there and staring at the ceiling
<BR>Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

<P>Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
<BR>And after all I'm only sleeping

<P>Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
<BR>Taking my time

<P>When I wake up early in the morning
<BR>Lift my head, I'm still yawning
<BR>When I'm in the middle of a dream
<BR>Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

<P>Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
<BR>Leave me where I am - I'm only sleeping
