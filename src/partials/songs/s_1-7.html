<p>Last night I said these words to my girl,
<br>I know you never even try, girl,
<br>Come on, come on, come on, come on
<br>Come on, come on, come on, come on
<br>Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you.
<p>You don't need me to show the way, love.
<br>Why do I always have to say love,
<br>Come on, come on, come on, come on
<br>Come on, come on, come on, come on
<br>Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you.
<p>I don't wanna sound complainin',
<br>But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart).
<br>I do all the pleasin' with you, it's so hard to reason
<br>With you, whoah yeah, why do you make me blue.
