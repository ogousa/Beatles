<P>I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.
<BR>She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
<BR>She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
<BR>So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.

<P>I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
<BR>We talked until two and then she said "It's time for bed".
<BR>She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
<BR>I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.

<P>And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown.
<BR>So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
