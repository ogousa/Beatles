<P>I've got a word or two
<BR>To say about the things that you do
<BR>You're telling all those lies
<BR>About the good things that we can have
<BR>If we close our eyes

<P>Do what you want to do
<BR>And go where you're going to
<BR>Think for yourself
<BR>'Cause I won't be there with you

<P>I left you far behind
<BR>The ruins of the life that you had in mind
<BR>And though you still can't see
<BR>I know your mind's made up
<BR>You're gonna cause more misery

<P>Do what you want to do
<BR>And go where you're going to
<BR>Think for yourself
<BR>'Cause I won't be there with you

<P>Although your mind's opaque
<BR>Try thinking more if just for your own sake
<BR>The future still looks good
<BR>And you've got time to rectify
<BR>All the things that you should

<P>Do what you want to do
<BR>And go where you're going to
<BR>Think for yourself
<BR>'Cause I won't be there with you

<P>Do what you want to do
<BR>And go where you're going to
<BR>Think for yourself
<BR>'Cause I won't be there with you
<BR>Think for yourself
<BR>'Cause I won't be there with you
