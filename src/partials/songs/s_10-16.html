<P>Who knows how long I've loved you
<BR>You know I love you still
<BR>Will I wait a lonely lifetime
<BR>If you want me to--I will.

<P>For if I ever saw you
<BR>I didn't catch your name
<BR>But it never really mattered
<BR>I will always feel the same.

<P>Love you forever and forever
<BR>Love you with all my heart
<BR>Love you whenever we're together
<BR>Love you when we're apart.

<P>And when at last I find you
<BR>Your song will fill the air
<BR>Sing it loud so I can hear you
<BR>Make it easy to be near you
<BR>For the things you do endear you to me
<BR>You know I will
<BR>I will.
