<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the benefit of Mr. Kite
<BR>There will be a show tonight on trampoline
<BR>The Hendersons will all be there
<BR>Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene
<BR>Over men and horses hoops and garters
<BR>Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
<BR>In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
<BR>The celebrated Mr. K.
<BR>Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
<BR>The Hendersons will dance and sing
<BR>As Mr. Kite flys through the ring don't be late
<BR>Messrs. K and H. assure the public
<BR>Their production will be second to none
<BR>And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
<BR>The band begins at ten to six
<BR>When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
<BR>And Mr. H. will demonstrate
<BR>Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground
<BR>Having been some days in preparation
<BR>A splendid time is guaranteed for all
<BR>And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill.
