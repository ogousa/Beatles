<P>Once there was a way to get back homeward
<BR>Once there was a way to get back home
<BR>Sleep pretty darling do not cry
<BR>And I will sing a lullabye

<P>Golden slumbers fill your eyes
<BR>Smiles awake you when you rise
<BR>Sleep pretty darling do not cry
<BR>And I will sing a lullabye

<P>Once there was a way to get back homeward
<BR>Once there was a way to get back home
<BR>Sleep pretty darling do not cry
<BR>And I will sing a lullabye
