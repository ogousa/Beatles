<P>It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
<BR>It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
<BR>But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
<BR>Will make me feel alright

<P>You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
<BR>And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
<BR>So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
<BR>You know I feel ok

<P>When I'm home everything seems to be right
<BR>When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

<P>Owww!

<P>So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
<BR>You know I feel ok
<BR>You know I feel alright
<BR>You know I feel alright
