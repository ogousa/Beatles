<P>Have you seen the little piggies
<BR>Crawling in the dirt
<BR>And for all the little piggies
<BR>Life is getting worse
<BR>Always having dirt to play around in.

<P>Have you seen the bigger piggies
<BR>In their starched white shirts
<BR>You will find the bigger piggies
<BR>Stirring up the dirt
<BR>Always have clean shirts to play around in.

<P>In their styes with all their backing
<BR>They don't care what goes on around
<BR>In their eyes there's something lacking
<BR>What they need's a damn good whacking.

<P>Everywhere there's lots of piggies
<BR>Living piggy lives
<BR>You can see them out for dinner
<BR>With their piggy wives
<BR>Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.
