<P>There are places I'll remember
<BR>All my life though some have changed
<BR>Some forever not for better
<BR>Some have gone and some remain
<BR>All these places have their moments
<BR>With lovers and friends I still can recall
<BR>Some are dead and some are living
<BR>In my life I've loved them all

<P>But of all these friends and lovers
<BR>There is no one compares with you
<BR>And these mem'ries lose their meaning
<BR>When I think of love as something new
<BR>Though I know I'll never lose affection
<BR>For people and things that went before
<BR>I know I'll often stop and think about them
<BR>In my life I love you more

<P>Though I know I'll never lose affection
<BR>For people and things that went before
<BR>I know I'll often stop and think about them
<BR>In my life I love you more
<BR>In my life I love you more
