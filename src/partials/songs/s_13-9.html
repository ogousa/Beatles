<P>My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
<BR>I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
<BR>I said move over once, move over twice
<BR>Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

<P>I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909 I begged her not to
<BR>go and I begged her on my bended knees,
<BR>You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me.
<BR>I said move over once, move over twice
<BR>Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

<P>I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
<BR>I got my bag, run to the station
<BR>Railman says you've got the the wrong location
<BR>I got my bag, run right home
<BR>Then I find I've got the number wrong

<P>Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
<BR>I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
<BR>I said move over once, move over twice
<BR>Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

<P>I said we're trav'ling on the one after 9 0,
<BR>I said we're trav'ling on the one after 9 0,
<BR>I said we're trav'ling on the one after 909.
