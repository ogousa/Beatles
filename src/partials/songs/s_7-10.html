<P>Your day breaks, your mind aches
<BR>You find that all the words of kindness linger on
<BR>When she no longer needs you

<P>She wakes up, she makes up
<BR>She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
<BR>She no longer needs you

<P>And in her eyes you see nothing
<BR>No sign of love behind the tears
<BR>Cried for no one
<BR>A love that should have lasted years!

<P>You want her, you need her
<BR>And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
<BR>You think she needs you

<P>And in her eyes you see nothing
<BR>No sign of love behind the tears
<BR>Cried for no one
<BR>A love that should have lasted years!

<P>You stay home, she goes out
<BR>She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
<BR>She doesn't need him

<P>Your day breaks, your mind aches
<BR>There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
<BR>You won't forget her

<P>And in her eyes you see nothing
<BR>No sign of love behind the tears
<BR>Cried for no one
<BR>A love that should have lasted years!
