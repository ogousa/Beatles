<p>One, two, free, four!
<p>Well, she was just seventeen,
<br>You know what I mean,
<br>And the way she looked was way beyond compare.
<br>So how could I dance with another (ooh)
<br>And I saw her standin' there.
<p>Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
<br>That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
<br>She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)
<br>And I saw her standin' there.
<p>Well, my heart went boom,
<br>When I crossed that room,
<br>And I held her hand in mine...
<p>Whoah, we danced through the night,
<br>And we held each other tight,
<br>And before too long I fell in love with her.
<br>Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)
<br>Since I saw her standing there
