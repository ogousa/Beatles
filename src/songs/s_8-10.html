<P>Lovely Rita meter maid.
<BR>Lovely Rita meter maid.
<BR>Lovely Rita meter maid.
<BR>Nothing can come between us,
<BR>When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
<BR>Standing by a parking meter,
<BR>When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
<BR>Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
<BR>In a cap she looked much older,
<BR>And the bag across her shoulder
<BR>Made her look a little like a military man.
<BR>Lovely Rita meter maid,
<BR>May I inquire discreetly,
<BR>When are you free,
<BR>To take some tea with me.
<BR>Took her out and tried to win her,
<BR>Had a laugh and over dinner,
<BR>Told her I would really like to see her again,
<BR>Got the bill and Rita paid it,
<BR>Took her home I nearly made it,
<BR>Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
<BR>Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
<BR>Where would I be without you,
<BR>Give us a wink and make me think of you.
