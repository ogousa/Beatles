<P>I've just seen a face,
<BR>I can't forget the time or place
<BR>Where we just meet.
<BR>She's just the girl for me
<BR>And want all the world to see
<BR>We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm.

<P>Had it been another day
<BR>I might have looked the other way
<BR>And I'd have never been aware.
<BR>But as it is I'll dream of her
<BR>Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.
<BR>Falling, yes I am falling,
<BR>And she keeps calling
<BR>Me back again.
<BR>I have never known
<BR>The like of this, I've been alone
<BR>And I have missed things
<BR>And kept out of sight
<BR>But other girls were never quite
<BR>Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da.
<BR>Falling, yes I am falling,
<BR>And she keeps calling
<BR>Me back again.
<BR>Falling, yes I am falling,
<BR>And she keeps calling
<BR>Me back again.
