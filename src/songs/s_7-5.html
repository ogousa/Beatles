<P>To lead a better life I need my home to be here...

<P>Here, making each day of the year
<BR>Changing my life with the wave of her hand
<BR>Nobody can deny that there's something there

<P>There, running my hands through her hair
<BR>Both of us thinking how good it can be
<BR>Someone is speking but she doesn't know he's there

<P>I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
<BR>I know I need never care
<BR>But to love her is to need her everywhere
<BR>Knowing that love is to share

<P>Each one believing that love never dies
<BR>Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

<P>I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
<BR>I know I need never care
<BR>But to love her is to need her everywhere
<BR>Knowing that love is to share

<P>Each one believing that love never dies
<BR>Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

<P>To be there and everywhere
<BR>Here, there and everywhere
