<P>One day you'll look to see I've gone.
<BR>For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
<BR>Some day you'll know I was the one.
<BR>But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
<BR>And now the time has come
<BR>And so my love I must go.
<BR>And though I lose a friend,
<BR>In the end you'll know, oooh.

<P>One day you'll find that I have gone.
<BR>For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
<BR>Yes, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
<BR>And now the time has come
<BR>And so my love I must go.
<BR>And though I lose a friend,
<BR>In the end you'll know, oooh.

<P>One day you'll find that I have gone.
<BR>For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
