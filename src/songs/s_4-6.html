<P>Mr. Moonlight
<BR>You came to me one summernight and from your beam you made my dream,
<BR>And from the world you sent my girl and from above you sent us love,
<BR>And now she's mine.
<BR>I think you're fine 'cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight.

<P>Mr. Moonlight, come again please, here I am on my knees,
<BR>Begging if you please, and the nights you don't come my way.
<BR>I'll pray and pray more each day, 'cause we love you, Mr.
<BR>Moonlight,
<BR>Mr. Moonlight.
