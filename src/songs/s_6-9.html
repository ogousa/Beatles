<P>Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
<BR>All about the girl who came to stay?
<BR>She's the kind of girl you want so much
<BR>It makes you sorry
<BR>Still, you don't regret a single day.
<BR>Ah girl! Girl!
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When I think of all the times I've tried to leave her
<BR>She will turn to me and start to cry
<BR>And she promises the earth to me
<BR>And I believe her.
<BR>After all this times I don't know why.
<BR>Ah, girl! Girl!

<P>She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
<BR>You feel a fool.
<BR>When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood.
<BR>She's cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

<P>Was she told when she was young the pain
<BR>Would lead to pleasure?
<BR>Did she understand it when they said
<BR>That a man must break his back to earn
<BR>His day of leisure?
<BR>Will she still believe it when he's dead?
<BR>Ah girl! Girl! Girl!
