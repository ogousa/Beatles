<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I've got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause I've just
<BR>Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, I'd get
<BR>Myself locked up today, but I can't so I cry instead.
<BR>I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet, I
<BR>Can't talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
<BR>I'd try to make you sad somehow, but I can't so I cry instead.
<BR>Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when
<BR>They start to stare, I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
<BR>But I'll come back again someday.
<BR>And when I do you'd better hide all the girls, I'm gonna
<BR>Break their hearts all 'round the world. Yes, I'm gonna
<BR>Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
<BR>Do, until then I'll cry instead.
