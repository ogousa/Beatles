<p>Anna,
<br>You come and ask me, girl,
<br>To set you free, girl,
<br>You say he loves you more than me,
<br>So I will set you free,
<br>Go with him.
<br>Go with him.
<p>Anna,
<br>Girl, before you go now,
<br>I want you to know, now,
<br>That I still love you so,
<br>But if he loves you mo',
<br>Go with him.
<p>All of my life,
<br>I've been searchin' for a girl
<br>To love me like I love you.
<br>Oh, now.. But every girl I've ever had,
<br>Breaks my heart and leaves my sad.
<br>What am I, what am I supposed to do.
<p>Anna,
<br>Just one more thing, girl.
<br>You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
<br>Go with him.
<p>Chorus
<p>Anna,
<br>Just one more thing, girl.
<br>You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
<br>Go with him.
