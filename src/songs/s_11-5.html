<P>It's all too much, It's all too much

<P>When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
<BR>And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

<P>It's all too much for me to take
<BR>The love that's shining all around you
<BR>Everywhere, it's what you make
<BR>For us to take, it's all too much

<P>Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
<BR>Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

<P>It's all too much for me to take
<BR>The love that's shining all around here
<BR>All the world's a birthday cake,
<BR>So take a piece but not too much

<P>Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
<BR>Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

<P>It's all to much for me to see
<BR>A love that's shining all around here
<BR>The more I am, the less I know
<BR>And what I do is all too much

<P>It's all too much for me to take
<BR>The love that's shining all around you
<BR>Everywhere, it's what you make
<BR>For us to take, it's all too much

<P>It's too much.....It's too much

<P>Too much too much too much (fade to end)
