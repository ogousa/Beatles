<P>I should have known better with a girl like you,
<BR>That I would love everything that you do;
<BR>And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do.
<BR>Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be,
<BR>This could only happen to me;
<BR>Can't you see, can't you see,

<P>That when I tell you that I love you, oh,
<BR>You're gonna say you love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh,
<BR>And when I ask you to be mine,
<BR>You're gonna say you love me too.
<BR>You love me too, you love me too.
