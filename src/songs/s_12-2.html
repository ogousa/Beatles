<P>Something in the way she moves
<BR>Attracts me like no other lover
<BR>Something in the way she woos me

<P>I don't want to leave her now
<BR>You know I believe her now

<P>Somewhere in her smile she knows
<BR>That I don't need no other lover
<BR>Something in her style that shows me

<P>Don't want to leave her now
<BR>You know I believe her now

<P>You're asking me will my love grow
<BR>I don't know, I don't know
<BR>You stick around now it may show
<BR>I don't know, I don't know

<P>Something in the way she knows
<BR>And all I have to do is think of her
<BR>Something in the things she shows me

<P>Don't want to leave her now
<BR>You know I believe her now
