<p>Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains.
<br>And they ain't the kind that you can see.
<br>Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah.
<p>Chains, well I can't break away from these chains.
<br>Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free.
<br>Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah.
<p>I wanna tell you, pretty baby,
<br>I think you're fine.
<br>I'd like to love you,
<br>But, darlin', I'm imprisoned by these...
<p>Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,
<br>And they ain't the kind that you can see,
<br>Oh, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me.
<p>Please believe me when I tell you,
<br>Your lips are sweet.
<br>I'd like to kiss them,
<br>But I can't break away from all of these...
<p>Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains.
<br>And they ain't the kind that you can see.
<br>Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah.
<p>Chains, chains of love...
