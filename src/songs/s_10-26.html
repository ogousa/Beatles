<P>She was a working girl
<BR>North of England way
<BR>Now she's hit the big time
<BR>In the U.S.A.
<BR>And if she could only hear me
<BR>This is what I'd say.

<P>Honey pie you are making me crazy
<BR>I'm in love but I'm lazy
<BR>So won't you please come home.

<P>Oh honey pie my position is tragic
<BR>Come and show me the magic
<BR>of your Hollywood song.

<P>You became a legend of the silver screen
<BR>And now the thought of meeting you
<BR>Makes me weak in the knee.

<P>Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
<BR>Sail across the Atlantic
<BR>To be where you belong.

<P>Will the wind that blew her boat
<BR>Across the sea
<BR>Kindly send her sailing back to me.

<P>Honey pie you are making me crazy
<BR>I'm in love but I'm lazy
<BR>So won't you please come home.
