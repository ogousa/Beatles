<P>Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
<BR>Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
<BR>The sun is up, the sky is blue
<BR>It's beautiful and so are you
<BR>Dear Prudence won't you come out and play

<P>Dear Prudence open up your eyes
<BR>Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
<BR>The wind is low the birds will sing
<BR>that you are part of everything
<BR>Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?

<P>Look around round
<BR>Look around round round
<BR>Look around

<P>Dear Prudence let me see you smile
<BR>Dear Prudence like a little child
<BR>The clouds will be a daisy chain
<BR>So let me see you smile again
<BR>Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?
