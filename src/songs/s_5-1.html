<P>Help, I need somebody,
<BR>Help, not just anybody,
<BR>Help, you know I need someone, help.

<P>When I was younger, so much younger than today,
<BR>I never needed anybody's help in any way.
<BR>But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,
<BR>Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.

<P>Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
<BR>And I do appreciate you being round.
<BR>Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
<BR>Won't you please, please help me.

<P>And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
<BR>My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
<BR>But every now and then I feel so insecure,
<BR>I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

<P>Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
<BR>And I do appreciate you being round.
<BR>Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
<BR>Won't you please, please help me.
