<P>Yes I'm lonely wanna die
<BR>Yes I'm lonely wanna die
<BR>If I ain't dead already
<BR>Ooh girl you know the reason why.

<P>In the morning wanna die
<BR>In the evening wanna die
<BR>If I ain't dead already
<BR>Ooh girl you know the reason why.

<P>My mother was of the sky
<BR>My father was of the earth
<BR>But I am of the universe
<BR>And you know what it's worth
<BR>I'm lonely wanna die
<BR>If I ain't dead already
<BR>Ooh girl you know the reason why.

<P>The eagle picks my eye
<BR>The worm he licks my bone
<BR>I feel so suicidal
<BR>Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
<BR>Lonely wanna die
<BR>If I ain't dead already
<BR>Ooh girl you know the reason why.

<P>Black cloud crossed my mind
<BR>Blue mist round my soul
<BR>Feel so suicidal
<BR>Even hate my rock and roll
<BR>Wanna die yeah wanna die
<BR>If I ain't dead already
<BR>Ooh girl you know the reason why.
