<P>Desmond has a barrow in the market place
<BR>Molly is the singer in a band
<BR>Desmond says to Molly-girl I like your face
<BR>And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
<BR>Obladi oblada life goes on bra
<BR>Lala how the life goes on
<BR>Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
<BR>Lala how the life goes on.

<P>Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
<BR>Buys a twenty carat golden ring
<BR>Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
<BR>And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

<P>In a couple of years they have built
<BR>A home sweet home
<BR>With a couple of kids running in the yard
<BR>Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

<P>Happy ever after in the market place
<BR>Molly lets the children lend a hand
<BR>Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
<BR>And in the evening she's a singer with the band.

<P>And if you want some fun-take Obladi Oblada.
