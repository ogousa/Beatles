<P>I'd like to be under the sea
<BR>In an octopus' garden in the shade
<BR>He'd let us in, knows where we've been
<BR>In his octopus' garden in the shade

<P>I'd ask my friends to come and see
<BR>An octopus' garden with me
<BR>I'd like to be under the sea
<BR>In an octopus' garden in the shade.

<P>We would be warm below the storm
<BR>In our little hideaway beneath the waves
<BR>Resting our head on the sea bed
<BR>In an octopus' garden near a cave

<P>We would sing and dance around
<BR>because we know we can't be found
<BR>I'd like to be under the sea
<BR>In an octopus' garden in the shade

<P>We would shout and swim about
<BR>The coral that lies beneath the waves
<BR>(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
<BR>Oh what joy for every girl and boy
<BR>Knowing they're happy and they're safe
<BR>(Happy and they're safe)

<P>We would be so happy you and me
<BR>No one there to tell us what to do
<BR>I'd like to be under the sea
<BR>In an octopus' garden with you.
