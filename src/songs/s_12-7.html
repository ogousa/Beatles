<P>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
<BR>and I say it's all right

<P>Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
<BR>Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
<BR>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
<BR>and I say it's all right

<P>Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
<BR>Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
<BR>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
<BR>and I say it's all right

<P>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
<BR>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
<BR>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
<BR>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
<BR>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

<P>Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
<BR>Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
<BR>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
<BR>and I say it's all right
<BR>It's all right
