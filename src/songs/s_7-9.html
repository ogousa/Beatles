<BR>&nbsp;

<P>You tell me that you've got everything you want
<BR>And your bird can sing
<BR>But you don't get me, you don't get me

<P>You say you've seen seven wonders and your bird is green
<BR>But you can't see me, you can't see me

<P>When your prized possessions start to wear you down
<BR>Look in my direction, I'll be round, I'll be round

<P>When your bird is broken will it bring you down
<BR>You may be awoken, I'll be round, I'll be round

<P>You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
<BR>And your bird can swim
<BR>But you can't hear me, you can't hear me
