<P>You don't realize how much I need you,
<BR>Love you all the time and never leave you.
<BR>Please come on back to me.
<BR>I'm lonely as can be.
<BR>I need you.

<P>Said you had a thing or two to tell me.
<BR>How was I to know you would upset me?
<BR>I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
<BR>You told me.

<P>Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore.
<BR>That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore.

<P>Please remember how I feel about you,
<BR>I could never really live without you,
<BR>So, come on back and see just what you mean to me.
