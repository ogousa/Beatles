<P>Two of us riding nowhere
<BR>Spending someone's
<BR>Hard earned pay
<BR>Two of us Sunday driving
<BR>Not arriving
<BR>On our way back home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're going home

<P>Two of us sending postcards
<BR>Writing letters
<BR>On my wall
<BR>You and me burning matches
<BR>Lifting latches
<BR>On our way back home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're going home

<P>You and I have memories
<BR>Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

<P>Two of us wearing raincoats
<BR>Standing so low
<BR>In the sun
<BR>You and me chasing paper
<BR>Getting nowhere
<BR>On our way back home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're going home

<P>You and I have memories
<BR>Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

<P>Two of us wearing raincoats
<BR>Standing so low
<BR>In the sun
<BR>You and me chasing paper
<BR>Getting nowhere
<BR>On our way back home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're on our way home
<BR>We're going home

<P>We're going home
<BR>Better believe it
