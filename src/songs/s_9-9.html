<P>In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
<BR>Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
<BR>And all the people that come and go
<BR>Stop and say hello.

<P>On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
<BR>The little children laugh at him behind his back.
<BR>And the banker never wears a mack
<BR>In the pouring rain, very strange.

<P>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
<BR>There beneath the blue suburban skies
<BR>I sit, and meanwhile back

<P>In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
<BR>And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
<BR>He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
<BR>It's a clean machine.

<P>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
<BR>A four of fish and finger pies
<BR>In summer, meanwhile back

<P>Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
<BR>The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
<BR>And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
<BR>She is anyway.

<P>In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
<BR>We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
<BR>And then the fireman rushes in
<BR>From the pouring rain, very strange.

<P>Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
<BR>There beneath the blue suburban skies
<BR>I sit, and meanwhile back.
<BR>Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
<BR>There beneath the blue suburban skies,
<BR>Penny Lane.
