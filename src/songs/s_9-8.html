<P>Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
<BR>Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.
<BR>Strawberry Fields forever.

<P>Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
<BR>It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it
<BR>doesn't matter much to me.
<BR>Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
<BR>Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.
<BR>Strawberry Fields forever.

<P>No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
<BR>That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right, that is
<BR>I think it's not too bad.
<BR>Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
<BR>Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.
<BR>Strawberry Fields forever.

<P>Always, no sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a
dream.
<BR>I think I know I mean a 'Yes' but it's all wrong, that is I think I
disagree.
<BR>Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
<BR>Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.
<BR>Strawberry Fields forever.
<BR>Strawberry Fields forever.
