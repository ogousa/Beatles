<P>You say you will love me
<BR>If I have to go.
<BR>You'll be thinking of me,
<BR>Somehow I will know.
<BR>Someday when I'm lonely,
<BR>Wishing you weren't so far away,
<BR>Then I will remember
<BR>The things we said today.

<P>You say you'll be mine, girl,
<BR>Until the end of time.
<BR>These days such a kind girl
<BR>Seems so hard to find.
<BR>Someday when we're dreaming,
<BR>Deep in love, not a lot to say.
<BR>Then we will tremember
<BR>The things we said today.

<P>Me, I'm just the lucky kind.
<BR>Love to hear you say that love is luck.
<BR>And, though we may be blind,
<BR>Love is here to stay. And that's enough
<BR>To make you mine, girl,
<BR>Be the only one.
<BR>Love me all the time, girl.
<BR>We'll go on and on.
<BR>Someday when we're dreaming,
<BR>Deep in love, not a lot to say.
<BR>Then we will remember
<BR>The things we said today.

<P>Love me all the time, girl.
<BR>We'll go on and on.
<BR>Someday when we're dreaming,
<BR>Deep in love, not a lot to say.
