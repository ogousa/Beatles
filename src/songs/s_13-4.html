<P>All thru' the day I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
<BR>All thru' the night I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
<BR>Now they're frightened of leaving it
<BR>Ev'ryone's weaving it,
<BR>Coming on strong all the time,
<BR>All thru' the day I me mine.

<P>I-me-me mine, I-me-me mine,
<BR>I-me-me mine, I-me-me mine.

<P>All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
<BR>Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
<BR>No-one's frightened of playing it
<BR>Ev'ryone's saying it,
<BR>Flowing more freely than wine,
<BR>All thru' the day I me mine.

<P>I-me-me mine, I-me-me mine,
<BR>I-me-me mine, I-me-me mine.

<P>All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
<BR>Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
<BR>No-one's frightened of playing it
<BR>Ev'ryone's saying it,
<BR>Flowing more freely than wine,
<BR>All thru' your life I me mine.
