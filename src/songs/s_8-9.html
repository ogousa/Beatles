<P>When I get older losing my hair,
<BR>Many years from now.
<BR>Will you still be sending me a valentine
<BR>Birthday greetings bottle of wine.
<BR>If I'd been out till quarter to three
<BR>Would you lock the door,
<BR>Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
<BR>When I'm sixty-four.
<BR>You'll be older too,
<BR>And it you say the word,
<BR>I could stay with you.
<BR>I could be handy, mending a fuse
<BR>When your lights have gone.
<BR>You can knit a sweater by the fireside
<BR>Sunday mornings go for a ride,
<BR>Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
<BR>Who could ask for more.
<BR>Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
<BR>When I'm sixty-four.
<BR>Every summer we can rent a cottage,
<BR>In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
<BR>We shall scrimp and save
<BR>Grandchildren on your knee
<BR>Vera Chuck &amp; Dave
<BR>Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
<BR>Stating point of view
<BR>Indicate precisely what you mean to say
<BR>Yours sincerely, wasting away
<BR>Give me your answer, fill in a form
<BR>Mine for evermore
<BR>Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
<BR>When I'm sixty-four.
