<P>In the town where I was born
<BR>Lived a man who sailed to sea
<BR>And he told us of his life
<BR>In the land of submarines

<P>So we sailed up to the sun
<BR>Till we found the sea of green
<BR>And we lived beneath the waves
<BR>In our yellow submarine

<P>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
<BR>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

<P>And our friends are all on board
<BR>Many more of them live next door
<BR>And the band begins to play

<P>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
<BR>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

<P>As we live a life of ease
<BR>Everyone of us has all we need
<BR>Sky of blue and sea of green
<BR>In our yellow submarine.

<P>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
<BR>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

<P>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
<BR>We all live in our yellow submarine,
<BR>Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
