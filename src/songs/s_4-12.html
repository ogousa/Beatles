<P>I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go,
<BR>I would hate my disappointment to show,
<BR>There's nothing for me here so I will disappear,
<BR>If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know.

<P>I've had a drink or two and I don't care,
<BR>There's no fun in what I do if she's not there,
<BR>I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long,
<BR>I think I'll take a walk and look for her.

<P>Though tonight she's made me sad,
<BR>I still love her,
<BR>If I find her I'll be glad,
<BR>I still love her.
