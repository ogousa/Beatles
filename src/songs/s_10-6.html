<P>Hey, Bungalow Bill
<BR>What did you kill
<BR>Bungalow Bill?

<P>He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
<BR>In case of accidents he always took his mom
<BR>He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son.
<BR>All the children sing

<P>Hey Bungalow Bill
<BR>What did you kill
<BR>Bungalow Bill?

<P>Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
<BR>Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
<BR>So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
<BR>All the children sing

<P>Hey, Bungalow Bill
<BR>What did you kill
<BR>Bungalow Bill?

<P>The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
<BR>Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
<BR>If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
<BR>All the children sing

<P>Hey, Bungalow Bill
<BR>What did you kill
<BR>Bungalow Bill?
