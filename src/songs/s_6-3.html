<P>When I call you up
<BR>Your line's engaged
<BR>I have had enough
<BR>So act your age
<BR>We have lost the time
<BR>That was so hard to find
<BR>And I will lost my mind
<BR>If you won't see me
<BR>You won't see me

<P>I don't know why
<BR>You should want to hide
<BR>But I can't get through
<BR>My hands are tied
<BR>I won't want to stay
<BR>I don't gave much to say
<BR>But I can't turn away
<BR>And you won't see me
<BR>You won't see me

<P>Time after time
<BR>You refuse to even listen
<BR>I wouldn't mind
<BR>If I knew what I was missing
<BR>Though the days are few
<BR>They're filled with tears
<BR>And since I lost you
<BR>It feels like years
<BR>Yes, it seems so long
<BR>Girl, since you've been gone
<BR>And I just can't go on
<BR>If you won't see me
<BR>You won't see me
