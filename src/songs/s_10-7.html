<P>I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
<BR>While my guitar gently weeps
<BR>I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
<BR>Still my guitar gently weeps
<BR>I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
<BR>I don't know how someone controlled you
<BR>They bought and sold you.

<P>I look at the world and I notice it's turning
<BR>While my guitar gently weeps
<BR>With every mistake we must surely be learning
<BR>Still my guitar gently weeps
<BR>I don't know how you were diverted
<BR>You were perverted too
<BR>I don't know how you were inverted
<BR>No one alerted you.

<P>I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
<BR>While my guitar gently weeps
<BR>Look at you all...
<BR>Still my guitar gently weeps.
