<P>I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
<BR>And stops my mind from wandering
<BR>Where will it go
<BR>I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
<BR>And kept my mind from wandering
<BR>Where will it go

<P>And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
<BR>I'm right
<BR>Where I belong I'm right
<BR>Where I belong.

<P>See the people standing there who disagree and never win
<BR>And wonder why they don't get in my door.
<BR>I'm painting my room in the colourful way
<BR>And when my mind is wandering
<BR>There I will go.

<P>And it really doesn't matter if
<BR>I'm wrong I'm right
<BR>Where I belong I'm right
<BR>Where I belong.

<P>Silly people run around they worry me
<BR>And never ask me why they don't get past my door.
<BR>I'm taking the time for a number of things
<BR>That weren't important yesterday
<BR>And I still go.
<BR>I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
<BR>And stops my mind from wandering
<BR>Where it will go.
