<P>Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
<BR>but she doesn't have a lot to say
<BR>Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
<BR>but she changes from day to day

<P>I want to tell her that I love her a lot
<BR>But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
<BR>Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
<BR>Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeh,
<BR>someday I'm going to make her mine.
