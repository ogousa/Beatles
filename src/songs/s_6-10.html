<P>I'm looking through you, where did you go
<BR>I thought I knew you, what did I know
<BR>You don't look different, but you have changed
<BR>I'm looking through you, you're not the same

<P>Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
<BR>Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
<BR>You don't sound differnt, I've learned the game.
<BR>I'm looking through you, you're not the same

<P>Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
<BR>Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

<P>You're thinking of me, the same old way
<BR>You were above me, but not today
<BR>The only difference is you're down there
<BR>I'm looking through you, any other way

<P>Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
<BR>Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

<P>I'm looking through you, where did you go
<BR>I thought I knew you, what did I know
<BR>You don't look different, but you have changed
<BR>I'm looking through you, you're not the same
