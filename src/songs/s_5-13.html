<P>Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
<BR>Now it looks as though they're here to stay
<BR>Oh, I believe in yesterday.

<P>Suddenly, I'm not half to man I used to be,
<BR>There's a shadow hanging over me.
<BR>Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

<P>Why she had to go I don't know she woldn't say.
<BR>I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

<P>Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
<BR>Now I need a place to hide away.
<BR>Oh, I believe in yesterday.

<P>Mm mm mm mm mm.
