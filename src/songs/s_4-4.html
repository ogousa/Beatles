<P>Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
<BR>Any old way you choose it
<BR>It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
<BR>Any old time you use it
<BR>It's gotta be rock roll music
<BR>If you wanna dance with me
<BR>If you wanna dance with me

<P>I've got no kick against modern jazz
<BR>Unless they try to play it too darn fast
<BR>And change the beauty of the melody
<BR>Until they sound just like a symphony

<P>That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
<BR>Any old way you choose it
<BR>It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
<BR>Any old time you use it
<BR>It's gotta be rock roll music
<BR>If you wanna dance with me
<BR>If you wanna dance with me

<P>I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
<BR>So she can hear my man awail a sax
<BR>I must admit they have a rockin' band
<BR>Man, they were goin' like a hurrican'

<P>That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
<BR>Any old way you choose it
<BR>It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
<BR>Any old time you use it
<BR>It's gotta be rock roll music
<BR>If you wanna dance with me
<BR>If you wanna dance with me

<P>Way down South they gave a jubilee
<BR>The jokey folks they had a jamboree
<BR>They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
<BR>The folks dancin' got all shook up

<P>And started playin' that that rock and roll music
<BR>Any old way you choose it
<BR>It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
<BR>Any old time you use it
<BR>It's gotta be rock roll music
<BR>If you wanna dance with me
<BR>If you wanna dance with me

<P>Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
<BR>I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
<BR>It's way to early for a congo
<BR>So keep a rockin' that piano
<BR>So I can gear some of that

<P>Rock and roll music
<BR>Any old way you choose it
<BR>It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
<BR>Any old time you use it
<BR>It's gotta be rock roll music
<BR>If you wanna dance with me
<BR>If you wanna dance with me
