<BR>Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
<BR>You could find better things to do, than to break my
<BR>Heart again, this time I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend.
<BR>I thought that you would realize that if I ran away from you that you
would want
<BR>Me too, but I've got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh
<BR>You could find better things to do, than to break my
<BR>Heart again, this time I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend.
<BR>I wanna go but I hate to leave you, you know I hate to leave you ,
oh ho,
