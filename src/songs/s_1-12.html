<br><i>(Writer: Bobby Scott, Ric Marlow; lead vocal: Paul McCartney)</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
<p>I dream of your first kiss, and then,
<br>I feel upon my lips again,
<br>A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
<p>I will return, yes I will return,
<br>I'll come back for the honey and you.
<p>Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
<br>There lingers still, 'though we're far apart,
<br>That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
<p>I will return, yes I will return,
<br>I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and
you.
