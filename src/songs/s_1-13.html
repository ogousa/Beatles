<br>&nbsp;
<p>There is a place,
<br>Where I can go,
<br>When I feel low,
<br>When I feel blue.
<br>And it's my mind,
<br>And there's no time when I'm alone.
<p>I think of you,
<br>And things you do,
<br>Go 'round my head,
<br>The things you said,
<br>Like "I love only you."
<p>In my mind there's no sorrow,
<br>Don't you know that it's so.
<br>There'll be no sad tomorrow,
<br>Don't you know that it's so.
<p>There is a place,
<br>Where I can go,
<br>When I feel low,
<br>When I feel blue.
<br>And it's my mind,
<br>And there's no time when I'm alone.
<p>There's a place...
