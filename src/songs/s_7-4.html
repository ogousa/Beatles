<P>Each day just goes so fast
<BR>I turn around - it's past
<BR>You don't time to hang a sign on me

<P>Love me while you can
<BR>Before I'm dead old man

<P>A lifetime is so short
<BR>A new one can't be bought
<BR>And what you've got means such a lot to me

<P>Make love all day long
<BR>Make love singing songs

<P>There's people standing round
<BR>Who screw you in the ground
<BR>They'll fill your head with all the things you see

<P>I'll make love to you
<BR>If you want me too
