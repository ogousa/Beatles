<BR><I>(Writer, lead vocal: Paul McCartney)</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Day after day alone on the hill,
<BR>The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
<BR>But nobody wants to know him,
<BR>They can see that he's just a fool,
<BR>And he never gives an answer,
<BR>But the fool on the hill
<BR>Sees the sun going down,
<BR>And the eyes in his head,
<BR>See the world spinning around.

<P>Well on his way his head in a cloud,
<BR>The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
<BR>But nobody ever hears him,
<BR>Or the sound he appears to make,
<BR>And he never seems to notice,
<BR>But the fool on the hill . . .
<BR>Nobody seems to like him
<BR>They can tell what he wants to do.
<BR>And he never shows his feelings,
<BR>But the fool on the hill . . .
